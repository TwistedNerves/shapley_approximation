# shapley_approximation

This repository is the code base of the paper "Approximating the Shapley value with sampling : survey and new stratification techniques". This work is part of the research and teaching chair [Retail Responsable](https://sites.laas.fr/projects/ChaireRetailResp/bienvenue) which works toward reducing the environmental and social impact of online retail.

The main two functions of this package are **generate_symetric_sum_instance** which generate a cooperative game with various parameters and **post_stratif_indicator_values** which computes the shapley value of a cooperative game (given in the form generated by the first function).

## Basic usage
```julia
include("/path_to_repository/shapley_paper/ShapleyApproximation.jl")
using .ShapleyApproximation

# Generate a cooperative game
nb_players = 20
nb_symetric_games = 5*nb_players
create_game_values = ShapleyApproximation.create_monotone_function
evaluation_function, _ = ShapleyApproximation.generate_symetric_sum_instance(nb_players, nb_symetric_games, create_game_values)

nb_samples = 100 * nb_players * nb_players

# Compute the Shapley value
shapley_value = ShapleyApproximation.post_stratif_indicator_values(evaluation_function, nb_players, nb_samples)
```
